# Recurrent-Neural-Network
This repository contains the software artefact produced as part of my undergraduate dissertation. It consists of 2 Hopfield Networks and 2 Bidirectional Neural Network working with visual and text data that aim to demonstrate the concept of Associative Memory. The essence of the Hopfield models is that when presented with a noisy or incomplete version of the input data, they should be able to "recall" the original shape/format and output the reconstructed, correct example. With a similar goal, the Bidirectional Neural Networks create associations between pairs of words and images, so when one is presented as input, its pair should be retrieved and displayed.\\
In addition to the models, I constructed an interactive and informative GUI which allows users with no experience in the field of Artificial Intelligence to experiment with the models and the concept of Associative Memory. Although interacting with the models is possible from the terminal, the GUI is more friendly for individuals with no technology background.
